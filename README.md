üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @GabrielZre,
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in programming, mostly in Kotlin.
- üëÄ Working as a Junior Android Developer engineer
- üå± I‚Äôm developing my electric scooter app which calculates the distance, time, average speed, driving economy and getting info about current battery state via bluetooth module,
extended by GPS tracker, to find the scooter. 
Users can save the trip details to database. 
Every saved trip is displayed in user history. 
In this project i am using FireBase, beacuse its easy to add functionality like forgot password, etc.
I have created 3 samples of this app:

- Preview: https://imgur.com/a/TkjkAIG
- Java, XML, Bluetooth Classic, Activity per Screen
- Electronic components: ESP32 Lolin32, SIM800L, GPS NEO-6M.

- Preview: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/180PfqgU7t8DS_TPqp1aF_xkUoQvVGw7S/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108568950519064346668&rtpof=true&sd=true
- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, BLE, Single Activity
- Electronic components: LILYGO TSIM 7608E-H, SIM800L, GPS NEO-6M.

Each of these projects is deprecated and does not reflect current skills, but they show the progress of my learning and learning new technologies. Many things could have been done easier in those projects, I admit that the SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles were missing, and design patterns also.

- üíûÔ∏è I am looking for an full time job as a Kotlin / Android developer. I am open to learning new technologies and cloud solutions.

  I am also open to other job offers üôÇ

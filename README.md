- 👋 Hi, I’m @GabrielZre
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, mostly in Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my scooter app which calculates the distance, time, average speed and getting info about current battery state via bluetooth module,
extended by GPS tracker, to find the scooter. Users can save the trip details to database. Every saved trip is displaying in user history. 
In this project i am using FireBase, beacuse its easy to add functionality like forgot password, etc. Electronic components will be connected by Adruino.
Everything is done, except electronics for this time.
- 💞️ I am looking for an internship as a Java developer. I am open to learning new technologies and cloud solutions.
- 📫 How to reach me: gabriel.zrebiec@gmail.com

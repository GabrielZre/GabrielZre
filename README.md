extended by GPS tracker, to find the scooter. Users can save the trip details to database. Every saved trip is displaying in user history. 
In this project i am using FireBase, beacuse its easy to add functionality like forgot password, etc. Electronic components will be connected by Adruino.
Everything is done, except electronics for this time.

extended by GPS tracker, to find the scooter. Users can save the trip details to database. Every saved trip is displayed in user history. 
In this project i am using FireBase, beacuse its easy to add functionality like forgot password, etc. Electronic components: ESP32 Lolin32, SIM800L, GPS NEO-6M.
